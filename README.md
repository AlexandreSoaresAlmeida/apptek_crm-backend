# BackEnd Example Project using Technologies: Springboot + JPA/Hibernate + REST + Lombok

Technologies:

| Technologies | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Springboot | Spring Boot is a Spring project that came to facilitate the process of configuring and publishing our applications. The intention is to have your project running as fast as possible and without complications. |
| JPA/Hibernate | Hibernate is the most used data persistence framework in Java projects. JPA is the Java specification that dictates how ORM frameworks should be implemented. |
| REST | REST, short for "REpresentational State Transfer", is not a technology, a library, nor an architecture, but rather a model to be used to design distributed software architectures, based on network communication.
| Lombok | is a framework for Java that lets you write code eliminating verbosity, which saves you development time for what's really important. Its use allows to generate at compile time getters and setters methods, constructor methods, builder pattern and much more..
